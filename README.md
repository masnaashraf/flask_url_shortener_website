# flask_url_shortener_website

The URL shortener application is a Flask web application that allows users to enter a long URL and receive a short URL in return. The user can then use the short URL to access the original long URL. The application uses a database to store the original long URL and the corresponding short URL, and retrieves the original URL when a user visits the short URL. The application also includes a feature to copy the short URL to the clipboard.
